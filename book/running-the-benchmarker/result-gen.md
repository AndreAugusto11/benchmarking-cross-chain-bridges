# Result-gen

```sh
yarn run result-gen:all
```

This is what we expect users to run as it generates plots and tables for each of the aggregators that we collected data for. The generated data is stored in  [benchmark-plots.md](../repository-overview/benchmark-plots.md "mention") and [benchmark-tables.md](../repository-overview/benchmark-tables.md "mention").&#x20;

```sh
yarn run result-gen:xy
```

can be used to generate results of individual aggregators
